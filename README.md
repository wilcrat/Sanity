# Sanity

## Content Management System

A Content Storage Platform. A Content backend that can be used with any front end

Sanity delivers content anywhere (just like a headless CMS). Beyond that, it gives you total composability. A fully decoupled, real-time content back end. Entirely customizable content workspaces.

To install Sanity, run

```bash
npm create sanity@latest
```

Then navigate to the directory of your project

```bash
cd Your-Project
```

To run the Sanity Studio run

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open the localhost port in the browser

## Sanity Studio

In this project, I'm using the Blog Schema Temmplate.
